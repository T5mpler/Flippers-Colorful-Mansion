# Flippers Colorful Mansion
Oh cool you're here. So if you need an explanation for this, this was a Baldi's Basics decompiled mod I made in 2020 that took around 6 months to make (more because of Unity crashing and all that stuff but still). It's obviously not the best but I'm still fond of it and I'm deciding to release the project and put it open source.

# Things you'll need

**There'll be some things you'll need to get the project working**

-Unity 2019.4.9f1

**Packages:**

-Post Processing 2.3.0
-Lightweight Renderpipline 7.3.1
-Text Mesh Pro 2.1.6

I'm not really sure if these come with the project but just in case they don't make sure you install these in the Package Manager!
